A digital Signature system for [round 3 of NIST PQC standardization process](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/round-3-submissions). [[Github repository]](https://github.com/fast-crypto-lab/rainbow-submission-round2)
[[official site]](https://www.pqcrainbow.org/)

Unfortunately, this signature system can not reach its claimed security level due to [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214) attack.
